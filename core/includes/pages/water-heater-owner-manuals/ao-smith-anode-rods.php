<h1 id="ao-smith-p1">Anode Rod Inspection</h1>
<p id="ao-smith-p2">The anode rod is used to protect the tank from corrosion. Most hot water tanks are equipped with an anode rod. The submerged rod sacrifices itself to protect the tank. Instead of corroding the tank, water ions attack and eat away the anode rod. This does not affect the water&rsquo;s taste or color. The rod must be maintained to keep the tank in operating condition.</p>
<p id="ao-smith-p3" class="note">NOTE: Artificially softened water is exceedingly corrosive because the process substitutes sodium ions for magnesium and calcium ions. The use of a water softener may decrease the life of the water heater tank.</p>
<p id="ao-smith-p4">Anode deterioration depends on water conductivity, not necessarily water condition. A corroded or pitted anode rod indicates high water conductivity and should be checked and/or replaced more often than an anode rod that appears to be intact. Replacement of a depleted anode rod can extend the life of your water heater. Inspection should be conducted by a qualified technician, and at a minimum should be checked every three years. Typical (but not all) signs of a depleted anode rod are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li id="ao-smith-li1">	The majority of the rods diameter is less than 3/8&rdquo;</li>
    <li id="ao-smith-li2">	Significant sections of the support wire (approximately 1/3 or more of the anode rod&rsquo;s length) are visible. If the anode rod shows signs of either or both it should be replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p id="ao-smith-p5" class="note">NOTE: Whether re-installing or replacing the anode rod, check for any leaks and immediately correct if found.</p>
