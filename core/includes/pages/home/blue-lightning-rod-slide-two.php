		<h1>Aluminum Anode Rods<br />or<br />Magnesium Anode Rods?</h1>
		<br />
			<p id="s10-p1">The advantages of Magnesium far exceed those of Aluminum.  Aluminum rods are most appropriate for customers with hard water conditions or those that use well water.  Even though aluminum may stand up a little better to harsher water conditions they often break down and sink to the bottom of your water heater.  This causes a nasty sludge to build up that must be cleaned to prevent harmful aluminum byproducts.  If you use an aluminum anode rod be sure to run cold water to flush your pipes out before drinking from the tap.  </p>
