		<h1>Magnesium Dissolves in Your Water<br />and is Eco-Friendly</h1>

			<p id="s11-p1">Magnesium dissolves in your water rather than flake away and collect at the bottom of your water heater.  Magnesium is very eco-friendly and is a vital element in all living things.  Even if you do not plan on drinking your hot water, you can be sure that whatever little bit does make it into your drinking water is enriching your health.</p>
